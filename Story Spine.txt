I’ll give you a clean, anime-inspired story overview, intentionally non-detailed, modular, and expandable. Think of this as the season outline, not the script.

XP MINIMA — HIGH-LEVEL STORY OVERVIEW

(Abstract Narrative Spine)

1. Genre & Vibe (Anchor First)

Genre blend:

Psychological RPG

Soft sci-fi / metaphysical fantasy

Existential mystery

Anime inspirations (structural, not aesthetic):

Ergo Proxy — identity, sealed truths

Serial Experiments Lain — reality vs perception

Attack on Titan (early seasons) — walls, containment, hidden systems

Made in Abyss — descent-based progression, irreversible knowledge

Steins;Gate — consequences of awareness

No flashy power scaling. No chosen-one speeches. Quiet dread.

2. Core Premise (One Paragraph)

The world is stable because something is contained.
Most people don’t know what it is — only that disasters stopped happening long ago.

The containment system is failing.

You awaken inside one of its anchor zones (the manor).
You are not the first anchor. You may be the last.

What happens next depends on whether you:

maintain the system,

escape it,

or dismantle it entirely.

3. World Structure (Outside the Manor)

The world is divided into functional zones, not “fantasy regions”.

Each zone exists because of the containment system.

Zone Types

Anchor Zones

Facilities like the manor

Designed to stabilize reality

Quiet, abandoned, ritualistic

Peripheral Settlements

Villages and towns near anchor zones

People live normal lives but follow strange customs

Superstitions replace truth

Relay Zones

Mountains, towers, underground chambers

Maintain the system’s flow

Heavily damaged or unstable

Dead Zones

Areas where containment failed briefly

Physics, memory, or biology behave incorrectly

No one stays long

You choose which to explore — and in what order.

4. Narrative Progression (Abstract Acts)
Act 1 — Awakening (Manor)

You learn how the world works mechanically

Hints of a larger system

No global stakes yet

Act 2 — Exposure (Outside World)

You see how normal life exists because of containment

NPCs deny obvious inconsistencies

Your stats begin shaping interpretation

Act 3 — Fracture

Zones start destabilizing

Events occur based on what you’ve ignored or explored

You realize inaction is also a choice

Act 4 — Decision

You learn the cost of each possible resolution

No option restores the world to a “perfect” state

The game asks what kind of future you accept

5. Thematic Axes (Use These to Design Everything)

Every location, NPC, or event should sit on at least one axis:

Stability vs Freedom

Ignorance vs Awareness

Preservation vs Evolution

Control vs Trust

If something doesn’t touch an axis, cut it.

6. Player Role (Abstract, No Lore Dump)

You are:

a stabilizer,

a witness,

and a variable.

Not a hero.
Not a villain.
A system anomaly.

Your growth is not power — it is capacity to choose.

7. Endings (High-Level Only)
Ending Types (Not Scripts)

Preserver Ending

World remains stable

You are lost to the system

Humanity continues unchanged

Liberation Ending

System is dismantled

World changes unpredictably

Humanity adapts or collapses

Escape Ending

You leave the system

World continues temporarily

Consequences deferred

Hidden Ending

Requires extreme stats / rare flags

System is redefined, not destroyed

Ambiguous, unsettling outcome

8. How Anime Inspiration Fits (Without Copying)

Use anime ideas like this:

AoT-style revelation → world truths arrive late and recontextualize earlier zones

Lain-style perception → low vs high Perception changes what the world seems to be

Made in Abyss descent → deeper exploration = irreversible knowledge

Ergo Proxy ambiguity → answers create more questions

Never explain everything. Let players argue online. That’s success.

9. Why This Overview Is Enough

This gives you:

Freedom to design locations

Freedom to invent NPCs

Freedom to grow lore organically

A consistent philosophical backbone

You can now:

design regions one by one,

write nodes without fear of contradiction,

scale the story safely.

10. Next Practical Step (Suggested)

Now that you have the story spine, the next logical design task is:

👉 Pick ONE zone outside the manor and define:

its purpose,

its dominant theme,

2–3 narrative questions it raises.

Not write scenes. Just define why it exists.
